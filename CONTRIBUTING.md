## Development

The plugin can be built with `./gradlew build`.

## Testing

Unit tests can be ran with `./gradlew test`.

Testing this in a live IDE requires loading it into a remote IDE launched via
Gateway; one way is to use `scp` to copy it to the workspace then install it in
the remote IDE as described in the readme.
